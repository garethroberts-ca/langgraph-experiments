38 LangGraph examples progressing from basic state machines to production patterns. Built around HR coaching use cases, but the patterns apply broadly.
What's here:

01-10: Fundamentals (state, routing, memory, tools, checkpointing)
11-18: Multi-agent systems (collaboration, reflection, risk handling)
19-24: Enterprise patterns (all 7 Anthropic agentic patterns, parallel processing)
25-34: LangGraph deep dives (time travel, Send API, streaming, error handling)
35-38: Domain applications (Culture Amp integrations, org psych frameworks)

Each example is self-contained and runnable. Start anywhere that interests you.
Questions, improvements, and war stories from your own implementations welcome.
